# Hospital-Patient-Scheduling-Simulator
SmartCare is a C-based program that simulates how hospitals can schedule patients for treatment using classic operating system (OS) CPU scheduling algorithms. Each patient is treated like a process, and their treatment details are used by the program to determine the most efficient and fair scheduling order.
